In addition， students will be required to demonstrate communicative competence and participate in all class discussions. More advanced methods for improving communicative competence will be introduced. Included in this approach， grammatical competence， as well as discourse  and strategic competence will be brought into focus. Students will watch portions of movies in each class and participate in discussions based on important contents and themes of the movies.  They will be required to answer questions on essay examinations at the completion of each movie. This is a very demanding class format， requiring full and committed participation on the part of all students in the class. Students will lose participation grades if they are not fully participating in classroom discussions or speaking Japanese in class. Regular attendance is a very important factor in receiving credit for this course.  Students will be required to do make up assignments for any missed assignments in the semester with written reports. A TOEFL score of 460 is desirable to this lower intermediate English course.  Returnees (students that have lived abroad) and other students seriously interested in improving their English skills are welcome in this course."
